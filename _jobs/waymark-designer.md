The UX designer creates satisfying or compelling experiences for users of a product, often drawing on results from user research and workflow analysis. Generally, UX designers need to possess strong creative, technical and problem-solving skills. The UX design role may involve psychology, storytelling and computer science as well. Areas of focus may include content, controls, visual design and development, information architecture, user research, branding and customer/technical support.

Responsibilities often include:

 * Consulting with clients to understand their goals and explaining research results
 * Conducting usability testing
 * Creating wireframes, storyboards, sitemaps and screen flows
 * Creating product prototypes
 * Developing personas and usage scenarios
 * Analyzing user feedback and activity, and iterating to enhance the user experience
 * Assisting with content development
 * Conducting competitor and customer analysis
 * UX designers must have a solid understanding of graphic design and web technologies, and of wireframing tools such as Axure RP and Balsamiq. 

 A good grasp of design programs and tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks and InVision is also necessary. UX designers must have the ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and a willingness to keep their skills and industry knowledge current. They frequently work with UI designers, web developers and graphic designers.
